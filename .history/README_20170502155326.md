pp can create an executable that includes perl and your script (and any module dependencies), but it will be specific to your architecture, so you couldn't run it on both Windows and linux for instance.

To make a stand-alone executable, suitable for running on a machine that doesn't have perl installed:

1. Install PAR::Packer. Example for *nix:
sudo cpan -i PAR::Packer
For Strawberry Perl for Windows or for ActivePerl and MSVC installed:
cpan -i PAR::Packer

2. Pack it with pp. It will create an executable named "example" or "example.exe" on Windows.
pp -o example example.pl
This would work only on the OS where it was built.

$a = 10;
my $var = <<"EOF";
This is the syntax for here document and it will continue
until it encounters a EOF in the first line.
This is case of double quote so variable value will be 
interpolated. For example value of a = $a
EOF
print "$var\n";

$var = <<'EOF';
This is case of single quote so variable value will not be 
interpolated. For example value of a = $a
EOF
print "$var\n";
# This will produce the following result

# Escaping Characters
# Perl uses the backslash (\) character to escape any type of character that might 
# interfere with our code. Let's take one example where we want to print double quote and $ sign
my $result = "This is \"number\"";
print "$result\n";
print "\$result\n";
# This will produce the following result
# This is "number"
# $result


# Perl Identifiers
# A Perl identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, class, module, or other object. 
# A Perl variable name starts with either $, @ or % followed by zero or more letters, underscores, and digits (0 to 9).
# Perl does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers. 
# Perl is a case sensitive programming language. Thus $Manpower and $manpower are two different identifiers in Perl.

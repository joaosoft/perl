# compile and run
pp can create an executable that includes perl and your script (and any module dependencies), but it will be specific to your architecture, so you couldn't run it on both Windows and linux for instance.

To make a stand-alone executable, suitable for running on a machine that doesn't have perl installed:

   % pp -o packed.exe source.pl        # makes packed.exe
   # Now, deploy 'packed.exe' to target machine...
   $ packed.exe

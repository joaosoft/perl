# Variables are the reserved memory locations to store values. 
# This means that when you create a variable you reserve some space in memory.

# We have learnt that Perl has the following three basic data types âˆ’
# - Scalars ($)
# - Arrays (@)
# - Hashes (%)

$age = 25;             # An integer assignment
$name = "John Paul";   # A string 
$salary = 1445.50;     # A floating point

print "Age = $age\n";
print "Name = $name\n";
print "Salary = $salary\n";
# This will produce the following result
# Age = 25
# Name = John Paul
# Salary = 1445.5

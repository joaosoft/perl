# A scalar is a single unit of data. That data might be an integer number, 
# floating point, a character, a string, a paragraph, or an entire web page.
$age = 25;             # An integer assignment

## Numeric Scalars

## String Scalars
$var = "This is string scalar!";

$double = "This is inside single quote - $var";
$escape = "This example of escape -\tHello, World!";

print "var = $var\n";
print "quote = $quote\n";
print "double = $double\n";
print "escape = $escape\n";

# This will produce the following result 
# var = This is string scalar!
# quote = I m inside single quote - $var                                                       
# double = This is inside single quote - This is string scalar!                                
# escape = This example of escape -       Hello, World


## Scalar Operations
$str = "hello" . "world";        # Concatenates strings.
$num = 5 + 10;                   # adds two numbers.
$mul = 4 * 5;                      # multiplies two numbers.
$mix = $str . $num;             # concatenates string and number.

print "str = $str\n";
print "num = $num\n";
print "mix = $mix\n";

# This will produce the following result 
# str = helloworld
# num = 15
# mix = helloworld15


## Multiline Strings
$string = 'This is
a multiline
string';

print "$string\n";
# This will produce the following result
# This is
# a multiline
# string


print <<EOF;
This is
a multiline
string
EOF
# This will also produce the same result
# This is
# a multiline
# string


## V-Strings
# A literal of the form v1.20.300.4000 is parsed as a string composed of characters 
# with the specified ordinals. This form is known as v-strings.
$smile  = v9786;
$foo    = v102.111.111;
$martin = v77.97.114.116.105.110; 

print "smile = $smile\n";
print "foo = $foo\n";
print "martin = $martin\n";
# This will also produce the same result
# smile = â˜º
# foo = foo
# martin = Martin
# Wide character in print at main.pl line 7.


## Special Literals
# So far you must have a feeling about string scalars and its concatenation and interpolation opration. 
# So let me tell you about three special literals __FILE__, __LINE__, and __PACKAGE__ represent the 
# current filename, line number, and package name at that point in your program.
print "File name ". __FILE__ . "\n";
print "Line Number " . __LINE__ ."\n";
print "Package " . __PACKAGE__ ."\n";

# they can not be interpolated
print "__FILE__ __LINE__ __PACKAGE__\n";

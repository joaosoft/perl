# Current Date and Time

# Let's start with localtime() function, which returns values for the current date and time if given no arguments. 
# Following is the 9-element list returned by the localtime function while using in list context âˆ’

# sec,     # seconds of minutes from 0 to 61
# min,     # minutes of hour from 0 to 59
# hour,    # hours of day from 0 to 24
# mday,    # day of month from 1 to 31
# mon,     # month of year from 0 to 11
# year,    # year since 1900
# wday,    # days since sunday
# yday,    # days since January 1st
# isdst    # hours of daylight savings time

@months = qw( Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec );
@days = qw(Sun Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun);

($sec,$min,$hour,$mday,$mon,$year,$wday,$yday,$isdst) = localtime();
print "$mday $months[$mon] $days[$wday]\n";


$datestring = localtime();
print "Local date and time $datestring\n";
# Local date and time Sat Feb 16 06:50:45 2013

# You should make a note on the fact that localtime() 
# will return the current local time on the machine that runs the script and gmtime() 
# will return the universal Greenwich Mean Time, or GMT (or UTC).

$datestring = gmtime();
print "GMT date and time $datestring\n";
# GMT date and time Sat Feb 16 13:50:45 2013


##### Format Date & Time
($sec,$min,$hour,$mday,$mon,$year,$wday,$yday,$isdst) = localtime();
printf("Time Format - HH:MM:SS\n");
printf("%02d:%02d:%02d", $hour, $min, $sec);
# Time Format - HH:MM:SS
# 06:58:52


### Epoch time
# You can use the time() function to get epoch time, i.e., 
# the numbers of seconds that have elapsed since a given date, in Unix is January 1, 1970.
$epoc = time();
print "Number of seconds since Jan 1, 1970 - $epoc\n";
# Number of seconds since Jan 1, 1970 - 1361022130


##### You can convert a given number of seconds into date and time string as follows 
$datestring = localtime();
print "Current date and time $datestring\n";

$epoc = time();
$epoc = $epoc - 12 * 60 * 60;   # one day before of current date.

$datestring = localtime($epoc);
print "Yesterday's date and time $datestring\n";



######## POSIX Function strftime()
# You can use the POSIX function strftime() to format date and time with the help of the following table. 
# Please note that the specifiers marked with an asterisk (*) are locale-dependent.

# Specifier	Replaced by	Example
# %a	Abbreviated weekday name *	Thu
# %A	Full weekday name *	Thursday
# %b	Abbreviated month name *	Aug
# %B	Full month name *	August
# %c	Date and time representation *	Thu Aug 23 14:55:02 2001
# %C	Year divided by 100 and truncated to integer (00-99)	20
# %d	Day of the month, zero-padded (01-31)	23
# %D	Short MM/DD/YY date, equivalent to %m/%d/%y	08/23/01
# %e	Day of the month, space-padded ( 1-31)	23
# %F	Short YYYY-MM-DD date, equivalent to %Y-%m-%d	2001-08-23
# %g	Week-based year, last two digits (00-99)	01
# %g	Week-based year	2001
# %h	Abbreviated month name * (same as %b)	Aug
# %H	Hour in 24h format (00-23)	14
# %I	Hour in 12h format (01-12)	02
# %j	Day of the year (001-366)	235
# %m	Month as a decimal number (01-12)	08
# %M	Minute (00-59)	55
# %n	New-line character ('\n')	
# %p	AM or PM designation	PM
# %r	12-hour clock time *	02:55:02 pm
# %R	24-hour HH:MM time, equivalent to %H:%M	14:55
# %S	Second (00-61)	02
# %t	Horizontal-tab character ('\t')	
# %T	ISO 8601 time format (HH:MM:SS), equivalent to %H:%M:%S	14:55
# %u	ISO 8601 weekday as number with Monday as 1 (1-7)	4
# %U	Week number with the first Sunday as the first day of week one (00-53)	33
# %V	ISO 8601 week number (00-53)	34
# %w	Weekday as a decimal number with Sunday as 0 (0-6)	4
# %W	Week number with the first Monday as the first day of week one (00-53)	34
# %x	Date representation *	08/23/01
# %X	Time representation *	14:55:02
# %y	Year, last two digits (00-99)	01
# %Y	Year	2001
# %z	
# ISO 8601 offset from UTC in timezone (1 minute = 1, 1 hour = 100)

# If timezone cannot be termined, no characters

# +100
# %Z	
# Timezone name or abbreviation *

# If timezone cannot be termined, no characters

# CDT
# %%	A % sign	%


use POSIX qw(strftime);

$datestring = strftime "%a %b %e %H:%M:%S %Y", localtime;
printf("date and time - $datestring\n");

# or for GMT formatted appropriately for your locale:
$datestring = strftime "%a %b %e %H:%M:%S %Y", gmtime;
printf("date and time - $datestring\n");

# Result: 
# date and time - Sat Feb 16 07:10:23 2013
# date and time - Sat Feb 16 14:10:23 2013
